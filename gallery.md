    <h3>MFEM [@Lawrence Livermore National Lab](https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/mfem-scalable-finite-element-discretization-library)</h3>
    MFEM is a modular parallel C++ library for finite element methods.
    Its goal is to enable the research and development of scalable finite element discretization and solver algorithms through general finite element abstractions, accurate and flexible visualization, and tight integration with the hypre library.

    <h3>Laghos [@CEED](http://ceed.exascaleproject.org/miniapps/#laghos-new)</h3>
    Laghos (LAGrangian High-Order Solver) is a miniapp that solves the time-dependent Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics in a moving Lagrangian frame using unstructured high-order finite element spatial discretization and explicit high-order time-stepping.

    <h3>NUMA [@Naval Postgraduate School](https://my.nps.edu/web/math/research)</h3>
    NUMA is a compressible Navier-Stokes solver specifically designed to solve the equations for applications in nonhydrostatic atmospheric modeling. NUMA solves the equations in a cube as well as on a sphere. NUMA is the dynamical core of the  U.S. Navy's NEPTUNE system.
