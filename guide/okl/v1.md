# v0.2 &nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp; v1.0

[Link to the full porting guide](https://github.com/libocca/occa/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.1#porting-from-v0.2-to-v1.0)

Throughout the website, you'll find examples with attributes such as `@outer` and `@kernel`.
Unfortunately, **v0.2** used keywords rather than attributes to label code.

Here are the currently supported **v0.2** keywords and their **v1.0** counterparts:

```cpp
/*
        v0.2                v1.0
  ----------------    ----------------
  shared           -> @shared
  exclusive        -> @exclusive
  unroll           -> @unroll
  kernel           -> @kernel
  barrier          -> @barrier
  restrict         -> @restrict
  volatile         -> @volatile
  outer, outer0... -> @outer, @outer(0), ...
  tile(256)        -> @tile(256)
*/
```

Until the **v1.0** OKL is merged into master, replace the documentation attributes with **v0.2** keywords

**Sorry for the inconvenience!**
